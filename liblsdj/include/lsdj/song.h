/* Song buffers are the representation of an LSDJ song uncompressed in memory.
   It hasn't been parsed yet into meaningful data. This is raw song data, and
   for example how the song in working memory within your LSDJ sav is repre-
   sented.

   From here, you can either compress song buffers into memory blocks, which is
   how all other projects in LSDJ are represented. You can also go the other
   way around, and parse them into an lsdj_song_t structure, providing you with
   detailed information about elements within your song. */
